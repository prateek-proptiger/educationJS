=> IDE - Integrated Development Environment is a software application which helps software engineers in developing applications.
JavaScript has many editors namely Webstorm, Atom and Sublime.
WebStorm is the only IDE with AngularJS plugin.

=> Running your application;-

With Yeoman: Just run yeoman server, will create a server and automatically refresh browser whenever changs made in code.
Without Yeoman:  You will need to configure a web server on your own. Expess is the simplest tool to be used. And this configuration could be run with the help of Node or Python.

=> Unit Test Cases -
Karma is an efficient Test Runner. It is configured by NPM and NodeJs. Install Karma.
karma init - Getting your config file up.
karma start - Starting Karma server.
karma run - Runs test cases.

=> Minifying :-
So as to decrease the file size, So that it could be loaded on userâ€™s browser fast.
We can use Google Closure but it gives normal minfication. For advanced you have to be more careful. Like using injector or array notation in case of controllers.=>

=> Debugging :-
For debugging purposes Chrome developer tools are very useful. Or you can use external plug-ins like Batarang.

=> Benefits with Yeoman:-

Adding a new Route is just as simple as => yeoman init angular:route routeName
In built server.
Running test cases is just as easy as => yeoman test
Building by => yeoman build

=> RequireJS :-

it is an asynchronous load-management tool which maintains that all your specified files are loaded before your script gets executed.

Need to learn how RequireJS works.
And then integrate it with Karma.
