'list-style-image': Specify the url for icon as url('/image/xyz.png');
'list-style-position': Specifies whether the list-item markers should appear inside or outside the content flow.

All elements in HTML can be considered as boxes.
Where each element is made up of Margin + Border + Padding + Content.
