Chapter-7 (Debugging and Tools)

We have learned how to integrate a new technology 'WebSocket' in our project but how to debug when things dont work as
expected ?
A typical WebSocket life cycle is:
1) Opening Handshake.
2) Sending and Receiving Frames.
3) Closing Handshake.

The Handshake
-------------
The data received by server from a valid client must include headers like Host, Connection, Upgrade etc.

Not of my level at present.
