Chapter-4 (STOMP over WebSocket)

Based upon the learning in previous chapters now we will layer another protocol on top of WebSocket.
STOMP - Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol, is a simple HTTP-like protocol for interacting with any STOMP message
broker.
Objective: To create a client and server that communicate using the STOMP protocol over WebSocket rather than TCP.
